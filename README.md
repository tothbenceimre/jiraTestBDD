# jiraTestBDD

This is an ongoing school project that aims to test Jira's features like:
* Log in
* Log out
* Edit issue

Because it is still ongoing my purpose is to cover as many features as I can. In the project I've used Page Object Model (POM), Keyword Driven Testing (KDT), and Data Driven Testing (DDT).

## About BDD

Behaviour-driven development (BDD) extends the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach by the ‘desired behaviour’ of a software. It is designed to ensure a collaboration between business analysts and developers with explicitly written down scenarios.

## Technologies used in the project
* Java
* Cucumber
* Selenium Webdriver

## Developers
``` Tóth Bence Imre ```
